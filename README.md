## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use custom properties in CSS for color management and how to make a card component responsive using Flexbox. Here's a snippet of code that demonstrates how I used custom properties and a mobile-first approach:

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue focusing on responsive design techniques, particularly how to use Flexbox and Grid together for more complex layouts. I also plan to explore using more advanced CSS features like animations and transitions to enhance the user experience.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs] - This is always a great resource for understanding HTML and CSS properties.
- [CSS Tricks] - Helped me understand how to create responsive layouts using Flexbox.
